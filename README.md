Unemployment Analysis using Python

Overview

This project dives into the impact of Covid-19 on employment trends. Using Python and specialized data analysis tools, we uncover insights into how the pandemic affected job markets in different regions.

Key Findings
Covid-19's Influence on Employment: The analysis reveals shifts in job patterns due to the pandemic. Some regions experienced more significant changes than others.

Predicting Future Trends: We explore how far the unemployment rate might rise in the future, providing valuable foresight for decision-making.

Regional Disparities: Notably, the North region showed the highest average unemployment rate at 15.89%. Post-lockdown, states like Puducherry, Jharkhand, Bihar, Haryana, and Tripura witnessed substantial spikes in unemployment rates.
